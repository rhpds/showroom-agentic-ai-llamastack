The tools available to me are designed for managing customer data, order history, invoices, and related tasks. They do not include functionality for retrieving general knowledge facts like the capital of Italy. You'll need to consult a geography resource or a general knowledge database for that information.

Try questions specific to the domain of the Agent thanks to the previously deployed and registered Customer and Finance MCP servers

In Terminal 1, check the logs of your Llama Stack instance to see what's going on under the hood:


[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
oc logs -f deploy/llamastack-distribution-vllm
----


Keep running queries to see traffic going from the agent to the MCP servers and the LLM through Llama Stack.
