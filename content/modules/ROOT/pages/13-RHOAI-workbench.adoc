= OpenShift AI Workbench Setup and usage

Another approach to executing the exercises of this workshop is to use the Red Hat OpenShift AI Workbench feature that gives you either a Jupyter Notebook, R Studio or Visual Studio Code Server development environment.

As the primary audience for this workshop is architects, platform engineers and developers, we will take the Code Server approach as seen in the screenshots.

Open the {console_url}[OpenShift Console^] as {user} and password {password} 

OR 

Open the 
https://data-science-gateway.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[OpenShift AI Console^] as {user} and password {password} 

Depending on your browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari) the different consoles may or may not work.

Select *Red Hat OpenShift AI* from the menu

Login to the OpenShift AI console using the same provided user id and password

Click *Workspace*

Click *Create a workbench*

Use the pattern "userN-workbench" for the workbench name

Select *Code Server* for *Workbench image*

and click *Create workbench*

Wait for it to start

When *Running* then click the name of the workbench

When it loads, it should look like the following.

This is Visual Studio Code but running in the browser and inside a pod

Open a *New Terminal* window

Paste error when using Command-V on Safari

Workaround on Safari is to use Command-V and also click the word "Paste" that appears where the mouse happens to be pointing.

Chrome will pop-up a warning, click *Allow*

After a successful copy & paste, hit "return" and execute the commands for the workshop

Remember, in Safari, the extra click on the hovering *Paste* takes some getting used to

Have the workshop documentation and the Code Server Workbench side-by-side.

With the Code Server Workbench you can see the Python script code as well as make changes.

You can open a 2nd terminal inside of Code Server Workbench when needed

Like VS Code, you can open multiple files for editing

== Helm 

This workshop uses *helm* CLI and it is not within the Code Server Workbench by default therefore you need to install it.
